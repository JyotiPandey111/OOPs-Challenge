# OOPs-Challenge

************************Please switch from main to master to access the code.**********************

Create at least 10 examples  of:
- Class and Object
- Inheritance 
- Private Public and Protected Abstraction Encapsulation
- Polymorphism Method Overriding
 
 - Packages Modules: Four Modules Created
   - Class_Object
   - Inheritance
   - PPP_Abs_Enc
   - Poly_Over
 - Exception Handling
 - Logging 
make sure use only ineuron, student, class, classtype, number of courses, 
affiliates, blog, internship, job, as an refernce example

## CLASS AND OBJECT:

Create 10 example of class and object constructor.

- class1: ineuron()--->[student_welcome(), student_total()]
- class2: ineuron_courses()--->[new_course_creation(),sub_course_count(), sub_course_deletion()]
- class3: ineuron_instructors()--->[instructor_registration, instructor_skills_update]
- class4: ineuron_students()--->[student_registration, student_mobile_update]
- class5: One_Neuron()--->[neuron_register, neuron_costing]
- class6: tech_ineuron_()--->[course_list, course_cost]
- class7: ineuron_internship()--->[Tech_list, domain_list]
- class8: ineuron_affiliates()--->[bank_update, create_affiliate_eligible]
- class9: ineuron_jobs()--->[jobs_search]
- class10: ineuron_blog()--->[blog_creation, blog_types]

## INHERITANCE:

A class inherit the attributes and functions of another class in addition to its own
attributes and functions that is when Inheritance is in use.
This promotes modular programming in production grade projects.

- Example 1,2,3 belongs to 1:1 INHERITANCE
  - EXAMPLE 1: INHERITANCE WITH CLASSES HAVING METHODS ONLY
  - EXAMPLE 2: INHERITANCE WITH PARENT CLASS HAVING METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES
  - EXAMPLE 3: INHERITANCE WITH PARENT AND CHILD CLASSES BOTH HAVING METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES

- EXAMPLE 4: MULTIPLE INHERITANCE WITH TWO PARENT AND ONE CHILD CLASS
- EXAMPLE 5: MULTIPLE INHERITANCE WITH ONE PARENT AND TWO CHILD CLASS
- EXAMPLE 6: MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE WITH THREE CLASSES
