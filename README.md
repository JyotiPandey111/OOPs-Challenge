# OOPs-Challenge


Create at least 10 examples  of:
- Class and Object
- Inheritance 
- Private Public and Protected Abstraction Encapsulation
- Polymorphism Method Overriding
 
 - Packages Modules: Four Modules Created
   - Class_Object
   - Inheritance
   - PPP_Abs_Enc
   - Poly_Over
 - Exception Handling
 - Logging 
make sure use only ineuron, student, class, classtype, number of courses, 
affiliates, blog, internship, job, as an refernce example

## CLASS AND OBJECT:

Create 10 example of class and object constructor.

- class1: ineuron()--->[student_welcome(), student_total()]
- class2: ineuron_courses()--->[new_course_creation(),sub_course_count(), sub_course_deletion()]
- class3: ineuron_instructors()--->[instructor_registration, instructor_skills_update]
- class4: ineuron_students()--->[student_registration, student_mobile_update]
- class5: One_Neuron()--->[neuron_register, neuron_costing]
- class6: tech_ineuron_()--->[course_list, course_cost]
- class7: ineuron_internship()--->[Tech_list, domain_list]
- class8: ineuron_affiliates()--->[bank_update, create_affiliate_eligible]
- class9: ineuron_jobs()--->[jobs_search]
- class10: ineuron_blog()--->[blog_creation, blog_types]

## INHERITANCE:

A class inherit the attributes and functions of another class in addition to its own
attributes and functions that is when Inheritance is in use.
This promotes modular programming in production grade projects.

- Example 1,2,3 belongs to 1:1 INHERITANCE
  - EXAMPLE 1: INHERITANCE WITH CLASSES HAVING METHODS ONLY
  - EXAMPLE 2: INHERITANCE WITH PARENT CLASS HAVING METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES
  - EXAMPLE 3: INHERITANCE WITH PARENT AND CHILD CLASSES BOTH HAVING METHODS AND ATTRIBUTES

- EXAMPLE 4: MULTIPLE INHERITANCE WITH TWO PARENT AND ONE CHILD CLASS
- EXAMPLE 5: MULTIPLE INHERITANCE WITH ONE PARENT AND TWO CHILD CLASS
- EXAMPLE 6: MULTI-LEVEL INHERITANCE WITH THREE CLASSES

## PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND PROTECTED:
- Public: Public methods and variables can be accessible everywhere. All the methods and attributes of class are public by default.
- Protected: Protected methods and variables can be accessible within the class in which it is defined and its parent or inherited classes and declared by '_' before the name.
- Private:   Private methods and variables can be accessible within the class only. Private method and variable is declared by using '__' before the name
Any number of Methods and Variables in class can be private, public and protected.
## ABSTRACTION: 
When there is a restriction on a user to ACCESS the attributes of the class directly,
             then Abstraction comes into play. In simple words, it is hiding  implementation.
             We can access the private attribute through method of the class.
## ENCAPSULATION: 
When there is a restriction on a user to MODIFY the attributes of the class directly,
               then Encapsulation comes into play.
               We can modify the private variable through method of the class.
               
               
## SAME METHOD NAMES IN DIFFERENT CLASSES: POLYMORPHISM
It causes different behaviours of particular instance in a different situation.
## SAME METHOD NAMES IN PARENT AND CHILD CLASS: OVERRIDING
Overriding happens when parent method get replaced by the child method when same method "name is used.
